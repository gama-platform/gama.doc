# Installation ## {#installation}

GAMA comes in 6 different versions (32 & 64 bits for Windows, Linux and MacOS). You first need to determine which version you are going to use (it depends on your computer, which may, or not, support 64 bits instructions, but also on the version of Java already installed, as the number of bits of the two versions must match).

You can then download the right version from the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/wiki/Download%20GAMA">github</a>, expand the zip file wherever you want on your machine, and [launch GAMA](references#Launching){.internal-link-anchor}.


## System Requirements ## {#system-requirements}


GAMA requires that Java 1.6 or 1.7 be installed on your machine, approximately 200MB of disk space is available and that a minimum of RAM (4GB is recommended) is installed (to increase the portion of memory usable by GAMA, please refer to  [these instructions](references#Troubleshooting#memory-problems){.internal-link-anchor} ).



## Installation of Java ## {#installation-of-java}

On Windows and Linux the recommended Java Virtual Machine under which GAMA has been tested is the one distributed by Oracle. On MacOS X, it is (still) the one distributed by Apple (see below). It may work with others â€” or not. For better performances, you may also want to install the JDK version of the JVM (and not the standard JRE), although is it not mandatory  (GAMA should run fine, but slower, under a JRE).
