### On MacOS X (Yosemite) ## {#on-macos-x-yosemite}
If you upgrade your Mac OS X version to **Yosemite** (latest version, aka Mac OS X 10.10), some changes in the management of Java Virtual Machines might prevent the GAMA displays from working and it will make your models crash the platform. One fix for this behavior is, **after** having upgraded Mac OS X, to install (or reinstall in case you have already installed it) the same « Java for OS X 2014-001 », available here: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572.

If you run the developer version of GAMA (i.e. under Eclipse), it is necessary, in that case, to reconfigure the "Installed JREs" (Preferences > Java > Installed JREs) so as to point JDK1.6 to the location where Yosemite now installs it (i.e. in `/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home`). See [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26450420/osx-10-10-and-eclipse-luna-own-app-crashes-when-started-from-inside-eclipse) for related information.
