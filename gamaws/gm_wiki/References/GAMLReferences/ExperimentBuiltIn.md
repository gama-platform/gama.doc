# The 'experiment' built-in species (Under Construction) ## {#the-experiment-built-in-species-under-construction}



As described in the [presentation of GAML](tutorials#Introduction), any experiment attached to a model is a species (introduced by the keyword `experiment` which directly or indirectly inherits from an abstract species called `experiment` itself. This abstract species (sub-species of `agent`) defines several attributes and actions that can then be used in any experiment.






## `experiment` attributes ## {#experiment-attributes}
`experiment` defines several attributes, which, in addition to the attributes inherited from [`agent`](references#AgentBuiltIn), form the minimal set of knowledge any experiment will have access to.
