Expressions in GAML are the value part of the [statements](references#Statements)' facets. They represent or compute data that will be used as the value of the facet when the statement will be executed.

An expression can be either a [literal](references#Literals), a [unit](references#UnitsAndConstants), a [constant](references#UnitsAndConstants), a [variable](references#PseudoVariables), an [attribute](references#VariablesAndAttributes) or the application of one or several [operators](references#Operators) to compose a complex expression.
