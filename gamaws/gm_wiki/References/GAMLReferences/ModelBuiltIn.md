As described in the [presentation of GAML](tutorials#Introduction), any model in GAMA is a species (introduced by the keyword [`global`](tutorials#GlobalSpecies)) which directly inherits from an abstract species called `model`. This abstract species (sub-species of [`agent`](references#AgentBuiltIn)) defines several attributes and actions that can then be used in any global section of any model.



## `model` attributes ## {#model-attributes}
`model` defines several attributes, which, in addition to the attributes inherited from [`agent`](references#AgentBuiltIn), form the minimal set of knowledge a model can manipulate.
